**pyjudge**

PyJudge is an Online Code Review System aka 'Online Compiler' similar to spoj.

The compiler uses Flask Microframework as the backend, and MaterializeCSS on the Frontend.

PyJudge is being updated for now, for better code organization.

The older version of this app is hosted @[pyjudge](https://flaskcompiler.herokuapp.com)
